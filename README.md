# Just My Type
This repository contains all of the files used for creating my first quarter project for Galvanize G27.  The project is used to find breweries and beers, and then recommend new beers to try based on the search.  It's intended for people who are at a brewery already and are enjoying a beer, and would like to find more beers like it.  
The home page contains two search bars to allow the user to begin their search by brewery or by beer.  
![alt text](/screenshot1.png)
If the user searches by brewery, he or she is taken to a page containing a description for the brewery and some of the beers that they serve.

If the user searches by beer, he or she is taken to a page containing some of the beers that are found by that search.

After this, the user can click on any beer on either page, and is taken to a new page that offers a description for that beer, as well as recommended beers based on that beer.

The user can repeat the process of clicking on a beer as much as he or she wants.

This project is deployed on Firebase.  The URL:
